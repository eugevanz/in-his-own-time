Write a simple input screen in HTML and JQUERY (no need to use controller methods).
The mock-up layout is below.

Functionality

- Each text box must hold only 50 characters.
- As the user types if the user goes over 50 it should automatically create a new textbox below the current and continue input.
- Each alternate textbox should have a light grey background.
- Clicking New Line should add a new blank textbox below the current textboxes.
- No more input is allowed when 1000 characters are reached.
- Clicking X will remove the current textbox, if there’s text prompt the user to confirm.
- As the user types, add the complete text into the textbox at the bottom

Optional: If you’re good.
- If the complete text doesn’t fit the bottom textbox, shrink the font size to make it fit.

Optional: If you’re really good
- Apply responsive design for an iPhone screen (you just need to cater for one size).
